# Athilekh
IMS PROJECT
Athilekh is a JAVA based Swing application that proposes to provide aid to the government by keeping a track of the number of tourists entering the country. Additionally, both arrival and departure details of the visitor are kept within the record including booking number, company thatâ€™s providing transport. Also, the means via which the traveler is entering or leaving the lands of the nation recorded like waterways, airways, roadways, etc. The system empowers the government by giving broadway surveillance of the count of the days left for a person to return to their country along with their VISA type.
The system has been designed by keeping all the possibilities in mind. In case the visitor has left the country or continues to stay inside the boundaries of the nation, all the activities of the visitor can be monitored and unsolicited population increase can be avoided. The design of the application will be highly robust and user friendly. In case a foreigner is a frequent visitor rather than taking all the details every time the user just needs to log in to his account and update the date of the visit, this would end up saving a lot of time. In today's world, the major issue faced by our nation is the ever-increasing population every day.
